# Graphify

Graphify is a simple tool:hammer: for visualizing:bulb: and analyzing information:chart_with_upwards_trend: for applications such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

It is critical to understand the link between every attribute and another attribute or target when developing a model to predict or categorize anything given a number of features contained in a dataset. With a single click, you can plot all of the graphs between each feature.

Graphify is constructed with Python:snake: and its associated libraries. The front endÂ is built with CustomKinter, and the graphs are created with Matplotlib:chart_with_upwards_trend:.
